# Precious

## Project Summary

The objective of this report was to analyze a disk image of a hard drive belonging to a supposedly innocent individual. Precious required the use of multiple Digital Forensics tools, such as Autopsy, Windows Registry Explorer, Windows Event Viewer, etc. in order to write a report summarizing my findings in a way that could be presented in court to prove the individual's innocence.

## Report

A copy of the report is available <a href="https://github.com/anthonysmithmyer/Precious/blob/main/Precious%20Report.pdf">here</a> and in the files tab.
